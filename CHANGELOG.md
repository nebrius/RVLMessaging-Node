## 6.2.1 (2021-11-14)

- Added "wl" prefix for interfaces to search

- Added `getDefaultInterface` and `getAvailableInterfaces` helper methods.

## < 6.2.0

Unfortunately I did not keep records of changes before 6.2.0, so you'll have to take a look at the commits associated with each release tag to see what changed. Sorry.
